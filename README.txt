In this assignemnt I created recognizer using DollarN, Protractor, and PennyPincher. Short story: Everything works!

When you open the application you have to load a database from the drop-down menu. The two databases consist of
strokes created using a pen(stylus) and a touchscreen. Each stroke has been drawn five times in each database
resulting in 100 strokes (200 total).

Once the database is selected, you can draw on the ink canvas and the three recongizers will attempt to recognize
what you drew using the strokes in the loaded database. The result will be posted in the display box. If one or
multiple of the recognizers are correct you can check their accuracy box and hi submit to display their accuracies.

Additionally, there is a symbol button to open a symbol editor. In the symbol editor you can create and load symbols
to add to the database you selected in the previous window.

Everything works correctly and there are a few hidden details in the program. Including the titles of the message
boxes and symbol creator. Have fun!
